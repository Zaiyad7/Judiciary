# Judiciary
This program matches and returns the title, date of trial, court name and judge name where available. If the judge name is not available,
information relating to the parties may be printed instead, or both the judge and the parties may be returned. This program has difficulty
matching judge name and trial dates for reports past page 280, due to changes in the html tags used.
