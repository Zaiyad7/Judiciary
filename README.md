# Judiciary
This program matches and returns the title, date of trial, court name and judge name where available for the judgments section of the judiciary website. In some cases  where the judge name is not available or harder to parse, a different string showing "Judge/Party info" will show
information relating to the parties, or both the names of the judges and parties. Currently this program has difficulty
matching judge name and trial dates for reports past page 280, due to changes in the html tags used for displaying the reports published 10+ years ago.
