# Judiciary
This program matches and returns the title, date of trial, court name and judge name where available for the judgments section of the judiciary website. In some cases  where the judge name is not available or harder to parse, a different string showing "Judge/Party info" will show
information relating to the parties, or both the names of the judges and parties. This program stops running after all reports on the website have been returned.
